# KMeans

Accuracy of algorithm : 85%

## Task

---

In this task, you will use K-means clustering to try to diagnose breast cancer based solely on a Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA), which as the name suggests, takes a very small tissue sample using a syringe(Figure 1).

To this end we will use the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset, containing information about 569 FNA breast samples. Each FNA produces an image as in Figure 2. Then a clinician isolates individual cells in each image, to obtain 30 characteristics (features), like size, shape, and texture. You will use these 30 features to cluster benign from malign FNA samples.

# ANN

## Task

---

In the context of this assignment, you will build an ANN structure by using MNIST train data to predict the MNIST handwritten digits. You will use MNIST test data to evaluate your trained ANN structure in terms of evaluation metrics that are accuracy and F1 score. You will codify your code with any programming languages (Python is a good choice). You can take advantage of some libraries such as scikit-learn, etc.
